# 0.0.1

- very basic web scraper, needs work on maintaining structure and viewing saved capsules

# backlog

- [x] figure out why `Segmentation fault: 11` keep happening in `website-scraper`
- [x] place capsules in the correct directory (timestamp them?)
- [x] be able to view saved capsules?
    - might just be a page that can search all of the saved files?
- write tests
- might be interesting instead of saving all of the html to just over an option to take a screenshot of all the pages?
